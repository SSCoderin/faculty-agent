[2025-08-15 09:50:03] I want to approach some faculty to guide my group for the following projects -
   1.  The Impact of Digital Feedback Loops on Self-Esteem and Motivation
    â€“ How do algorithmically-curated feedback systems (likes, views, comments) on social media affect self-esteem and intrinsic motivation?
2. Neurodivergence and Representation
3. Mental Health Interventions and Awareness in Schools
Who do you think are the best people at FLAME to guide me on this? Please list some papers which align with these topics.
