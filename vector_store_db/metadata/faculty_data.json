    "Bio": "Dr. Sane comes to FLAME after a career in research and industry. His early research was in the development of Software Tools and Distributed Computing. He transitioned to industry to lead development in a Software Tools startup. Subsequently he worked as the primary architect for Ecommerce systems, and then as architect of Web Search Crawlers and Indexers, followed by work on Semantic Web and Social Sites.\nHe invented a variety of algorithms and approaches to software system design for these projects. Over the years, his work has ranged over systems involving simple discrete electronics and 8-bit microprocessors, to single user desktop tools, to web service platforms, to billion user web systems executing on multi-thousand node clusters; he has led a variety of engineering organizations ranging from tiny teams at startups to teams of mostly-PhD engineers at large companies.\nHe has enjoyed both the diversity of computing ideas and the interplay of people and software. His research resulted in several patents and six hundred plus citations in the literature. Since 2015, he has been working on developing a notion of program design as a variant of mathematical modeling. In creating various computing systems, he noticed that the most elegant solutions resulted from building a model of the underlying rules of the problem domain, much as scientists capture the key aspects of a problem in the form of mathematical models. Turning this around, truly understanding an algorithm or a formula becomes easier if we know the original context in which the theory was created. Studying examples of great thinkers from Galileo and Newton to Turing shows us how to go from vague informal descriptions to precise formulations. We can thus develop our ability to first perceive new problems, and then to create or adapt techniques to tackle them.\nDr. Sane shifted from his industrial career to pursue this vision of teaching mathematics and computing.\nHe studied the history of science and maths, exploring how symbolic, mathematical thinking played a role in understanding natural phenomena. He then designed and taught maths and computing courses to students in various age groups, ranging from 8 year olds, 8th graders, 12th graders, and Masters and Ph.D. students, all in same year! This was a truly remarkable experience, to study and learn from the responses of students of such a variety of age groups to this way of learning. At FLAME, he expects to develop these ideas into an interesting and enjoyable computing program that will deliver a unique experience to students.",

In opposition to the view that an “objective” reality exists independently of the knower, theories of rhetoric emphasize that “truth” is necessarily constructed and distorted by varied, and often conflicting, social interests.\nHe contends, however, that existing scholarship on rhetoric, despite its valuable insights, has gone too far in emphasizing these “subjective” aspects of knowledge. Consequently, the humanities have found themselves increasingly unable to contribute in meaningful ways to contemporary public discourse. He therefore seeks to develop new approaches to thinking about rhetoric by drawing upon thinkers and intellectual traditions that have either been overlooked or unfairly sidelined in the humanistic disciplines.",

    "Bio": "Alexios Tsigkas is a sociocultural anthropologist whose research examines the intersections of aesthetics and economic life. Prior to joining FLAME University he held teaching and research positions at the department of Social Anthropology and Cultural Studies (ISEK), University of Zürich and the department of Ethnology, University of Lucerne, Switzerland. He studied anthropology in Athens, where he received a BA degree from Panteion University of Social and Political Sciences; in Paris, as an exchange student; and in New York, earning MA and PhD degrees from The New School for Social Research.\nAlexios' research comprises a sustained examination of taste as an object of anthropological inquiry. Specifically, it asks how taste judgments are made and shared in market contexts and how value is produced through practices of discernment. He has conducted long-term fieldwork in Sri Lanka and his research has been supported by the Social Science Research Council, the Wenner-Gren Foundation, and the American Council of Learned Societies. In the future, he hopes to explore how machine learning and artificial intelligence might reconfigure the judging and sharing of taste and the role of tastemakers and experts.\nAlexios has taught various courses across disciplinary boundaries, including anthropology and critical social theory, food studies, cultural studies, and design. His research and teaching interests include economic anthropology, food studies, aesthetics, knowledge production and expertise, with a regional focus on South Asia.\nBesides anthropology, he has previously ventured into the artworld: in Athens, he joined the Frissiras Museum for Contemporary European Painting and in 2009 he participated in the 2nd Athens Art Biennial, “Heaven LIVE.” In addition, at The New School, he was a fellow at the Graduate Institute for Design, Ethnography and Social Thought.",

Using a mixed-methods approach, he demonstrated how the Indian ‘hydrocracy’ securitised the governance of transboundary rivers. He also highlighted the inadequacies of international water law in addressing the hegemony of some states on shared rivers. His research was at the intersection of environmental security and international law. He has conducted fieldwork in India and Nepal.

    "Bio": "Kedar A. Kulkarni is a literary historian and theorist who situates Indian literature and performance traditions within global paradigms, borrowing lenses from colonial and postcolonial studies, comparative literature, and theatre and performance studies. He has written about slavery, caste, and gender in South Asia, aspects of intellectual history and theory, book history, historical poetics, and genre. His research focuses on literature and performance in Marathi, Sanskrit, English, and occasionally Hindi.\nKedar’s first book,\nWorld Literature and the Question of Genre in Colonial India: Poetry, Drama, and Print Culture 1790-1890\n(Bloomsbury 2022), won the American Comparative Literature Association’s Helen Tartar First Book Subvention Grant. In it, he argues that like English literature, whose curricular outlines were invented in the colonies, so too Indian vernacular literatures underwent a dramatic transformation over the course of the nineteenth century. The book\ndescribes the way Marathi literary culture, entrenched in performative modes of production and reception, especially balladry and epic storytelling, saw the germination of a robust, script-centric dramatic culture, owing to colonial networks of literary exchange and the wide availability of\nprint technology. Kedar showcases an upheaval in literary culture as a new class of literati emerged: anthologists, critics, theatre-makers, publishers, and translators, among many others. Reading through archives and ephemera, the book also demonstrates that literary cultures in colonized locales converged with and participated fully in key defining moments of world literature, but also diverged from them to create, simultaneously, unique literary modernity.\nMore recently, Kedar is at work on a new project, tentatively called\nAnimal Aesthetics. Animal Aesthetics\nargues for a more nuanced textual and epistemological understanding of animals in a country such as India, where dominant academic and cultural paradigms from the (residually Christian) global north are not as pervasive. In the book, he combines environmental discourse with aesthetics and scientific texts. He juxtaposes texts as diverse as Darwin’s\nDescent of Man\nand the Ramayana, and theorists such as Jacques Lacan with Anandavardhana, among others. Though he focuses on human-animal entanglements, firmly within a paradigm of postcolonial animal studies and environmental humanities,\nAnimal Aesthetics\nwill also resonate with topics in hermeneutics, postcritical approaches to literature, and religious and secular discourse.",

Her current book examines global heritage food movements in a warming, unequal world. She writes at the intersection of ethnography, cultural theory, and food politics, always asking: whose traditions are celebrated, commodified, or erased-and to what end? Whether the object of study is chocolate, coffee, or cows eating trash, she is most broadly interested in food’s relationship to knowledge and power.\nAfter receiving a joint Ph.D. from the University of California, San Diego and Irvine in performance studies, and picking up professional theater credits at Moxie Theater and The Old Globe in San Diego, she completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the Freie Universität Berlin. She quit academia to become a cultural journalist and performance critic (NPR Berlin, Exberliner Magazine, Theatertreffen, Tanz im August) but found her way back to the classroom. She teaches courses in theory, performance studies, and gender studies, where she encourages students to connect theory to performance, literature, and their own lives. Her research on contemporary European performance has been published in TDR, Performance Research, European Stages, and Theater Journal. Lily also writes for broader publics, with essays in Emergence Magazine, Vittles, Gastro Obscura, the Kitchn, and elsewhere.

    "Bio": "Formerly trained as an architect, Riyaz Latif received his PhD in Art History from the University of Minnesota at Minneapolis, USA, with a Mellon Foundation Fellowship from the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR), and Barakat Foundation, USA. After completing his Ph.D., he held a postdoctoral position at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Subsequently, he taught at Wellesley College in Massachusetts, and then at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, USA until the summer of 2017.\nAs an art historian he primarily invested in premodern Islamicate cultures, his work seeks to address art and architectural expressions emerging out of composite cultural interactions in the western Mediterranean rim, especially in the Maghrib (western North Africa), as well as the circulation of material artifacts through trade, travel and maritime relationships, which profoundly connect the premodern Islamicate world with Europe on the one hand and South Asia on the other. His writing has also engaged with the visuality of water and landscapes. Academically, his work seeks to override disciplinary boundaries, where art historical inquiry is informed by historical and cultural, archeological, anthropological as well as literary--‐textual resources.\nOver and above art and architectural history, Riyaz Latif’s other association extends to the realm of Indo--‐Persian literature and culture, especially the cultural world of Urdu. Along with two collections of poetry in Urdu, as well as a book of translations into Urdu from European poetry, he has published a number of articles, and has translated Urdu poetry and prose into English.",

Before that, she had obtained graduate-level degrees in Economics from JNU, New Delhi and the University of Calcutta. Broadly, her research lies at the interdisciplinary crossroads of family sociology and gerontology involving themes around living arrangements, social capital, health policy, older adult sexualities and theory development in aging studies. In another line of inquiry, she examines the complex nexus of motherhood, sexual politics and the biomedical markets. Her work has been funded by research grants from the United Nations Population Fund, Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR), Government of Gujarat, Population Foundation of India, University of California, San Diego (School of Medicine), University of Haifa (Israel) and the Global Liberal Arts Alliance (GLAA). Recently, she was invited as a Mercator Fellow (Summer 2024) with the Universities of Tübingen and Goethe University Frankfurt, Germany.\nApart from research, she remains committed to student engagement and contributing to an emerging community of early career researchers. In this role, she has mentored several graduate students and postdoctoral researchers and have served on academic committees and curriculum development boards.\nCurrently, she serves on the editorial boards of the journal, The Sociological Review (SAGE), the Journal of Aging Studies (Elsevier) and Social Theory & Health (Palgrave Macmillan). Prior to joining FLAME University, she was a faculty with the Department of Humanities & Social Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology, Gandhinagar, India, where she taught undergrad and graduate students for about 8 years.\nhttps://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-10-1654-7",

    "Bio": "Prof. Vikash Pandey is a mathematical physicist with research interests at the interface of applied mathematics and applied physics. His research primarily focuses on the physics of complex systems and the resulting memory-driven emergent power-law behavior. After receiving M.Sc. degree in Physics from the Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, he worked as a geophysicist for a seismic company in US, UK, and Africa. Thereafter, he earned his PhD degree from the University of Oslo, Norway. He did postdoctoral research at the University of Oslo and UiT, The Arctic University of Norway in Tromsø. His publications encompass the fields of fractional calculus, acoustics, fractal geometry, viscoelasticity, non-Newtonian rheology, dielectrics, and nonlinear bubble dynamics. Identifying the underlying mechanism of observed physical phenomena and the ability to describe them with an appropriate mathematical formulation gives him an unmatched joy. His long-term research goal is to extend the applications of fractional calculus to the traditional branches of physics, such as quantum physics and cosmology.\nIn addition to the research, teaching has been an important part of his academic training. After his postdoctoral experience, he began his teaching career in India at Ahmedabad University, Gujarat, followed by the University of Petroleum & Energy Studies (UPES), Dehradun, and Krea University, Sricity. Following his passion for teaching, he served as a mentor in one of the massive open online courses (MOOC) offered by the University of Rochester, USA, through Coursera. He was also a representative for the engineering acoustics committee of the Acoustical Society of America.\nFurther, he has been actively involved with the public outreach of scientific discoveries because he believes such outreach is necessary to cultivate scientific temper and critical thinking among the masses. His hobbies are hiking and trekking in the woods, bird-watching, and motorcycling.",
