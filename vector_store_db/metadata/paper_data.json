Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly in machine learning, have led to high hopes regarding the possibilities of using automatic techniques to perform some of the tasks that are currently done manually using visualization by data analysts. However, visual analytics remains a complex activity, combining many different subtasks. Some of these tasks are relatively low-level, and it is clear how automation could play a role—for example, classification and clustering of data. Other tasks are much more abstract and require significant human creativity, for example, linking insights gleaned from a variety of disparate and heterogeneous data artifacts to build support for decision making …"

    "paper_abstract": "There exists a gulf between the rhetoric in visualisation research about the significance of uncertainty and the inclusion of representations of uncertainty in visualisations used in practice. The graphical representation of uncertainty information has emerged as a problem of great importance in visualisation research. This contribution presents a survey of 286 uncertainty visualisation research publications. All publications are categorised with regard to publication type, publication venue, application domain, target user, and evaluation type. We present an interactive web-based browser that facilitates easy visual search and exploration of the publications included in the survey. We conclude that uncertainty visualisation is severely limited by the quality and scope of uncertainty data, by the limited confidence in the data, and by the perceptual and cognitive confusion that the graphical representation of the data can …"

    "paper_abstract": "We argue that visualization research has overwhelmingly focused on users from the economically developed world. However, billions of people around the world are rapidly emerging as new users of information technology. Most of the next billion users of visualization technologies will come from parts of the world that are extremely populous but historically ignored by the visualization research community. Their needs may be different to the types of users that researchers have targeted in the past, but, at the same time, they may have even more to gain in terms of access to data potentially affecting their quality of life. We propose a call to action for the visualization community to identify opportunities and use cases where users can benefit from visualization; develop universal design principles; extend evaluations by including the general population; and engage with a wider global population."

This case focuses on the financial challenges faced by Ambee Automation, a technology startup; and how the founders and employees of the startup had tactfully resolved it. Ambee Automation had completed projects for one of their big clients, TekTool, but the owner of the TekTool, Rajesh, did not clear the dues even after the successful completion of the project. Rajesh was all along pretending that he was facing financial problems and was putting up false excuses to defer payment to Prasad. Prasad, one of the owners of Ambee Automation, was facing serious problems related to working capital management and urgently needed funds to keep the startup running. Prasad understood that Rajesh was taking advantage of their weak position in the market because being a startup company they didn’t have many contacts in the industry. After deliberating on many possible solutions, Prasad decided to implement a rather risky, even somewhat unethical, solution. This solution needed to be implemented immediately for the very survival of the company and saving the jobs of its employees. Engineers of Ambee Automation surreptitiously inserted a timer in the software solution they had deployed at TekTool in a way that the software program running the critical equipment at TekTool stopped functioning within two days of the insertion.

Open defecation is often approached as a problem scaled at the site of the individual, who makes a choice not to build and/or use a toilet. Attempts to end rural open defecation by targeting individuals, like social marketing or behavior change approaches, often ignore the structural inequalities that shape rural residents’ everyday lives. Our study explores the question, “What is the role of remoteness in sustaining open defecation in rural India?” We deploy the concept of remoteness as an analytical tool that can capture everyday practices of open defecation as a function of physical and social distance.

All the village communities in the ONPC largely depend on the forest resources for their daily sustenance, particularly fuel-wood and non-timber forest products such as tendupatta, mahua, kullu and dhavda gums. The local people typically engage as gatherers of non-timber forest resources, farmers or work as labors on other agricultural farms. Enclosing, this forest commons, threatens the livelihood opportunities of adivasis. Hence, this dissertation questions how compensatory conservation transforms the forest governance and the economic activities of the local communities. I examine how rules-in-use control spatial actions alter economic, political and social relationships within proposed ONPC in central India. I gathered the economic, social and political data through interviews, case-studies and surveys. Farmers benefit from the creation of the ONPC as a biodiversity offset, while other villagers engaged in off-farm and NTFP extraction labor, are more economically vulnerable. Adivasi depend mostly on the forest resource extraction for their income generation. Therefore, with increasing restrictions placed on the resource access and control, resource users are forced to travel outside their villages in search of wage labor."

    "paper_abstract": "With the ongoing demographic and epidemiological transition, cancer is emerging as a major public health concern in India. This paper uses nationally representative household survey to examine the overall prevalence and economic burden of cancer in India. The age-standardized prevalence of cancer is estimated to be 97 per 100,000 persons with greater prevalence in urban areas. The evidence suggests that cancer prevalence is highest among the elderly and also among females in the reproductive age groups. Cancer displays a significant socioeconomic gradient even after adjusting for age-sex specifics and clustering in a multilevel regression framework. We find that out of pocket expenditure on cancer treatment is among the highest for any ailment. The average out of pocket spending on inpatient care in private facilities is about three-times that of public facilities. Furthermore, treatment for about 40 percent of cancer hospitalization cases is financed mainly through borrowings, sale of assets and contributions from friends and relatives. Also, over 60 percent of the households who seek care from the private sector incur out of pocket expenditure in excess of 20 percent of their annual per capita household expenditure. Given the catastrophic implications, this study calls for a disease-based approach towards financing such high-cost ailment. It is suggested that universal cancer care insurance should be envisaged and combined with existing accident and life insurance policies for the poorer sections in India. In concluding, we call for policies to improve cancer survivorship through effective prevention and early detection. In particular …"

    "paper_abstract": "AYUSH, an acronym for Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa-Rigpa and Homeopathy represents the alternative systems of medicine recognized by the Government of India. Understanding the patterns of utilization of AYUSH care has been important for various reasons including an increased focus on its mainstreaming and integration with biomedicine-based health care system. Based on a nationally representative health survey 2014, we present an analysis to understand utilization of AYUSH care across socioeconomic and demographic groups in India. Overall, 6.9% of all patients seeking outpatient care in the reference period of last two weeks have used AYUSH services without any significant differentials across rural and urban India. Importantly, public health facilities play a key role in provisioning of AYUSH care in rural areas with higher utilization in Chhattisgarh, Kerala and West Bengal. Use of AYUSH among middle-income households is lower when compared with poorer and richer households. We also find that low-income households display a greater tendency for AYUSH self-medication. AYUSH care utilization is higher among patients with chronic diseases and also for treating skin-related and musculo-skeletal ailments. Although the overall share of AYUSH prescription drugs in total medical expenditure is only about 6% but the average expenditure for drugs on AYUSH and allopathy did not differ hugely. The discussion compares our estimates and findings with other studies and also highlights major policy issues around mainstreaming of AYUSH care."

We adopt a gender lens and present a disaggregated view of age-sex specific COVID-19 infection and mortality risk in India.MethodsWe use crowdsourced data (https://www. covid19india. org/) to provide preliminary estimates for age-sex specific COVID-19 case fatality rate (CFR) for India. We analyse the burden of the cases and deaths for age-sex categories. CFR is estimated as the ratio of confirmed deaths in total confirmed cases. We report binomial confidence interval for the CFR estimates. Also, an adjusted-CFR is developed to capture the potential mortality among the currently active infections.ResultsAs of May 20, 2020, males share a higher burden (66%) of COVID-19 infections than females (34%) but the infection is more or less evenly distributed in under-five as well as elderly age groups. The CFR among males and females is 2.9% and 3.3%, respectively. The age-specific COVID-19 CFR assumes ‘Nike-swoosh’pattern with elevated risks among the elderly. The World Health Organization world standard population structure standardized CFR for India is 3.34%. The adjusted-CFR is estimated to be 4.8%.ConclusionEarly evidence indicates that males have higher overall burden, but females have a higher relative-risk of COVID-19 mortality in India.

This paper provides empirical evidence regarding the net growth benefits derived from an increased share of working-age population in India. The analysis adopts decomposition and econometric methods, using data at the state and national level in India, to robustly test the nature and magnitude of the demographic dividend in India. We find that the Indian economy is drawing significant benefits from the ongoing process of demographic transition, with dividend effects estimated to be over one percentage point per annum during 1980–2010. However, to derive high growth from the demographic potential would require tackling some of the growth constraints. The paper discusses ways in which these constraints can be addressed to fully tap the potential of demographic dividend."

    "paper_abstract": "Disassembly is an important process that is normally performed before any other product recovery technique is implemented. The End-Of-Life (EOL) products received for product recovery are disassembled to help satisfy all the demands. When the products are received by a product recovery facility, the quality or the conditions of the received EOL products are unknown. This uncertainty leads to stochastic disassembly yields. In this paper, an Advanced-Remanufacturing-To-Order-Disassembly-To-Order system (ARTODTO), which uses heuristic techniques to convert the stochastic disassembly yields into their deterministic equivalents, is proposed. Once the deterministic problem is formulated, multi-criteria decision-making techniques are used to evaluate the design alternatives of EOL products, and to determine the best design or combination of designs to satisfy all the demands, and constraints. In this paper, four criteria are considered for evaluating the design alternatives, viz., total profit, procurement cost, purchase cost, and disposal cost in three periods. A multi-criteria decision making technique known as Goal Programming (GP) is used to solve the problem. An example using Air Conditioners (ACs) is considered to illustrate the implementation of the methodology."

We conducted semi-structured interviews on 59 subjects from India to investigate the impact of information, misinfodemics (spread of wrong information), and isolation on their psychology. We perform qualitative analysis on the data. Our findings reveal that flow of information leads to anxiety, caution, and knowledge; while misinfodemics cause panic, distrust, and confusion; and isolation creates cognitive dissonance (the state of having inconsistent thoughts, beliefs, or attitudes) and adaptability among masses. The encouraging part of our findings is that, as of now, the situation is far from the state of depression. Practically, our research calls upon the government to support the masses in fighting through the crisis by focusing on pointed psychological counseling. We contribute theoretically to the body of knowledge in the field of social psychology, which is studying the psychological interventions to avoid panic amid pandemic.

Key postulates for this theory have been completely or partially fulfilled. In the absence of supportive evidence for alternative theories despite decades of research, it is important for the scientific community and conservation agencies to recognize and manage the threat of chytridiomycosis to remaining species of frogs, especially those that are naive to the pathogen. The impact of chytridiomycosis on frogs is the most spectacular loss of vertebrate biodiversity due to disease in recorded history."

To obtain a picture of how research is being focused towards these key questions, we undertook a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature (2014 and 2015) attributing papers to the original 20 questions. In total, we reviewed 605 articles in full and from these 355 (59%) were judged to substantively address the 20 key questions, with others focusing on basic science and monitoring. Progress to answering the 20 questions was not uniform, and there were biases regarding focal turtle species, geographic scope and publication outlet. Whilst it offers some …"

Bovine serum albumin (BSA) is known to reduce inhibition of PCR when samples are contaminated with these inhibitors. We assessed the effect of BSA in reducing inhibition of the TaqMan® assay when analyzing skin swabs for B. dendrobatidis. We found that the addition of BSA to the TaqMan® reaction reduced inhibition to insignificant levels. BSA did not appreciably affect the efficiency or analytical sensitivity of the TaqMan® reaction in the analysis of standard DNA solutions free from environmental inhibitors. We recommend the addition of 400 ng µl–1 of BSA to the standard TaqMan® assay to reduce inhibition associated with sampling wild amphibians."

    "paper_abstract": "Homeless people are perhaps the most faceless and voiceless group in a cityâ€™ s populace. It is imperative that they are given a voice to articulate their views and experiences. So far, there have been a few analytical studies in the West which have tried to capture the lived experiences of the homeless. However, very few studies in India have incorporated their world views and perspectives, as a result of which, we do not know much about their day to day life experiences. Therefore, for addressing the problem of homelessness and for planning interventions, it is necessary to understand and document the various causes and cultures of homelessness by incorporating the lived experiences and world views of the homeless. This paper argues that while building a nuanced peoplesâ€™ narrative in this manner, the concept of habitus and social field as given by Pierre Bourdieu can prove to be of immense value."

Anthropogenic disturbance, especially urbanization, changes a range of environmental factors including habitat characteristics and predation risk. As a consequence of differences in microhabitat structure and repeated exposure to anthropogenic disturbance, we hypothesize that animals in urban environments will be less risk averse than those in rural environments. Here, we examined the importance of extrinsic and intrinsic factors to understand the escape strategies of Psammophilus dorsalis across an urban-rural gradient. First, urban lizards used lower perches and chose refuges that were closer to their perches compared to rural lizards. Flight initiation distance (FID) of urban lizards in the field was shorter than that of rural …"

For animals living in urbanized areas, local environments not only are altered but can rapidly change during their lifetime. Urban residents are therefore challenged with identifying novel dangers and safe refuges in dynamic environments. We demonstrate that the tropical agamid lizard Psammophilus dorsalis experiences dramatically different habitats not only across the rural to urban spatial scale but also over the short temporal scale of a few years in suburban areas. Differences in environmental stability are expected to affect rates of learning and reversal learning in resident lizards. In testing arenas, lizards from these populations were required to choose a designated ‘safe’ refuge instead of an ‘unsafe’ one after simulated predator attacks.

Some species such as rock agamas, Psammophilus dorsalis, seem to be sufficiently tolerant and continue to persist in urban environments. Given that urbanization alters species composition at multiple trophic levels, we expect a shift in the diet composition and hunting modes of populations across rural and urban areas. Based on identified contents from stomach flushes, we found that P. dorsalis are generally myrmecophagous, and their diet is mainly composed of ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). Diet of males and females in each area overlapped highly (80–91%), even though males were significantly larger than females. Dietary overlap between urban and rural populations also was high (80.3%).

This is known as bait-shyness or the Garcia effect. Humans demonstrate this by avoiding a certain food following the development of nausea after ingesting that food (‘Sauce Bearnaise effect’). Here, we show that the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis is capable of the Garcia effect. A single ‘pairing’ of a novel taste, a carrot slurry followed hours later by a heat shock stressor (HS) is sufficient to suppress feeding response elicited by carrot for at least 24 h. Other food tastes are not suppressed. If snails had previously been exposed to carrot as their food source, the Garcia-like effect does not occur when carrot is ‘paired’ with the HS. The HS up-regulates two heat shock proteins (HSPs), HSP70 and HSP40. Blocking the up-regulation of the HSPs by a …"

Predator detection can be innate or can be acquired through learning. We studied prey–predator interactions in the larval bronzed frogs (Sylvirana temporalis), which have the innate ability to detect certain predators. We conducted a series of experiments to determine if the larval S. temporalis rely solely on innate predator detection mechanisms or can also learn to use more specific cues such as conspecific alarm cues for the purpose. The results of our study clearly indicate that larval S. temporalis use both innate and learned mechanisms for predator detection. Predator-naïve tadpoles could detect kairomones alone as a potential threat and responded by reducing activity, suggesting an innate predator detection mechanism. Surprisingly …"

Earlier definitions explaining informality in context of market arrangements across the Global south often failed to present a cohesive, inclusive framework vital for analysing (urban) informal, socioeconomic arrangements as an integral part of rapidly urbanizing developing economies. This essay seeks to examine the extent of this epistemological conflict while reviewing some of the classical studies on urban informality. We argue how an inclusive framework to urban policy planning is needed to avoid a broader generalization of the subject. Since the developing countries of South and South East Asia constitute a large share of workers being employed in the informal market arrangements; an inclusive perspective in understanding informality is warranted and emphasised upon in this essay."

It measures the ruling party’s political stronghold on the basis of constituency level electoral outcomes and shows that greater stronghold of the ruling party in a state leads to significantly higher proportion of revenue budget allocated for developmental expenditure. It also shows that voters’ turnout and political regime change have positive and significant effect on proportion of revenue budget allocated for developmental expenditure. However, political ideology, within government fragmentation, disproportionality in representation, and effective number of political parties do not have any significant impact on budget allocation decisions of the Indian state governments. Results of this paper also indicate that greater reliance on market forces reduces the share of developmental expenditure. These are new and robust results."

    "paper_abstract": "Colonial encounters with tropical ecosystems were primarily driven by profit-oriented management practices; witness the extensive network of timber and forestry practices that were set up across colonial India. In contrast, the colonial engagement with the montane forest-grassland mosaics of the higher reaches of the Western Ghats in southern India was marked by intensive investment in vegetation management by colonial foresters that yielded no profits. In this archival study, we trace the history of extensive vegetation transformation in this landscape from the early nineteenth to the early twentieth century. We show how the misperception that the grasslands within this mosaic must have resulted from tree felling, fire-setting and buffalo grazing by indigenous communities led colonial foresters into a century-long effort at ‘foresting’ the grasslands, primarily through large-scale planting of exotic tree species. These …"

    "paper_abstract": "Forest–grassland mosaics, with abrupt boundaries between the two vegetation types, occur across the globe. Fire and herbivory are widely considered primary drivers that maintain these mosaics by limiting tree establishment in grasslands, while edaphic factors and frosts are generally considered to be secondary factors that reinforce these effects. However, the relative importance of these drivers likely varies across systems. In particular, although frost is known to occur in many montane tropical mosaics, experimental evidence for its role as a driving factor is limited. We used replicated in situ transplant and warming experiments to examine the role of microclimate (frost and freezing temperatures) and soil in influencing germination and seedling survival of both native forest trees and alien invasive Acacia trees in grasslands of a tropical montane forest–grassland mosaic in the Western Ghats of southern India …"

Such data are now increasingly being generated using various types of public surveys. These data are often integrated with occupancy models to evaluate distributional patterns, range dynamics and conservation status of multiple species at broad spatio‐temporal scales. Occupancy models have traditionally corrected for imperfect detection due to false negatives while implicitly assuming that false positives do not occur. However, public survey data are also prone to false‐positive errors, which when unaccounted for can cause bias in occupancy estimates. We test whether false positives in a dataset collected from public surveys lead to overestimation of species site occupancy and whether estimators that simultaneously account for false‐positive and false …"

The Levelized Cost of Energy is usually used to make decisions and measure the plant’s economic feasibility. Literature suggests that MRE technology is still costly, and many emerging countries are sensitive to the income and use of MRE. Among various types of MREs, wind energy is the most feasible for many countries. Offshore wave energy is still at the pre-commercialization stage for many developing countries. Tidal energy plants can be economically viable depending on a reduction in investment cost and high capacity factors. Most of the world’s tidal flows have too low a speed to operate a turbine of commercial size for ocean thermal energy. In conclusion, the factors hindering MRE development are pointed out, and future challenges are discussed."

The Bush administration’s implied recognition of India’s nuclear weapons, and its abrupt reversal of three decades of sanctions to restore Indian access to nuclear fuel, reactors, and dual-use technologies despite being a non-proliferation treaty non-signatory, led to contentious debates in both India and the USA. A Debate to Remember emphasizes the multifaceted debate in India over the nuclear deal using concepts from science and technology studies. It focuses on the intense contestation over the civil-military mix of India’s separation plan, the competition between the Iran–Pakistan–India pipeline and the nuclear deal, the role of retired nuclear scientists, and the issue of liability that has stalled the full implementation of the nuclear deal. The impact of domestic factors on issues ranging from the civil-military status of breeder reactors to the Indian insistence on no restriction on future nuclear testing in the 123 Agreement is also revealed in this book."

The powerful paradigm of “Smart Cities” with its heavy techno-infrastructural focus has been advanced by proponents as a solution to enable rapid and efficient urbanization and to successfully deal with the challenges that come with it. ICT is accorded an important role in the very definition of the smart city, understood as a “city in which Information and Communication Technology is merged with traditional infrastructures, coordinated and integrated using new digital technologies”(Batty et al., 2012, p. 481). This has created a new form of digital citizenship, accompanied by claims of newer and more easily deployable opportunities for citizen engagement and participation. At the same time, the smart city also risks creating a technocratic state with growing concerns regarding citizen inclusion in governance, privacy, and surveillance. This chapter attempts to examine the smart city paradigm’s particular understanding of urbanization, the way it has manifested in India and the peculiar kind of top-down, citizen engagement it has fostered."

In addition to socioeconomic differences, poor healthcare infrastructure, and inadequate risk-pooling mechanisms; asymmetric information in the healthcare market is also a potential contributor to this inequity and increasing costs. The consequences of information asymmetry are adverse selection (AS) and moral hazard (MH). AS occurs if people with health risks (high-risk individuals) are more prone to buying health insurance as compared to low-risk individuals. MH occurs when insured individuals are more likely to use healthcare than the uninsured individuals, inflating insurance premiums and medical care costs.

Innovation in the payment system can potentially impact output, prices, and monetary policy transmissions. However, there is a conspicuous lack of work on the role of the payment system in driving economic activity, especially for an emerging economy like India. This paper examines the dynamic linkage between a digital payment system, real-time gross settlement (RTGS), and economic growth in India, using a multivariate Bayesian vector autoregressive (BVAR) model. Using monthly observations on the value and the volume of RTGS, we show that the value of RTGS has a significant impact on both income and price level in the economy. Our results also indicate that both RTGS and economic growth positively and significantly impact each other, supporting the existence of bidirectional causality between the two. A variance decomposition analysis confirms that both RTGS and economic activity contribute significantly to each other's fluctuations. Several sensitivity analyses reinforce our main findings."

Research has shown that the impact of raising a neurodivergent child is different for mothers and fathers. However, most studies focus solely on mothers, and there is insufficient research in the Indian context. It was hypothesised that the emotion regulation, well-being indicators and coping strategies used by fathers and mothers of neurodivergent children are significantly different. 19 mothers and 10 fathers of children (aged 10-16 years) diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and Learning Disabilities, from the Aatman Academy, Thane participated in the study. The Brief-Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced Inventory (Carver, 1997), Multidimensional Flourishing Scale (Mesurado et al., 2018), Peace of Mind Scale (Lee et al., 2012), and the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire-Short Version (Garnefski & Kraaij, 2006) were used to assess coping strategies, well-being and emotion regulation, respectively. A Mann-Whitney U test revealed differences in maternal and paternal results, but they were not significant. Plausible explanations include increased paternal involvement in child-rearing, the dyadic stress model, emotional interdependence in mothers and fathers and communal coping. This study is comprehensive, uses standardised questionnaires, and includes fathers. It can aid mixed methods and longitudinal research on the topic, and in designing timely interventions for parents of neurodivergent children in India."

It is not unusual for hydro-development projects between the two to run into delays or opposition, despite great domestic need for water and electricity in both countries. Using fieldwork in Delhi and Kathmandu, this paper illustrates the factors that impede cooperation between the two sides on shared rivers and how the inadequacies of international water laws manifest themselves in bilateral negotiations on water governance. The paper locates the benefit-sharing framework in international water law using the case studies of the Pancheshwar and the SaptaKoshi–SunKoshi Project in the Mahakali and Koshi basins."

It uncovers the various ways Indian hydrocracy uses its institutional and technical expertise to strengthen India’s centrality in Nepal’s water and hydropower sectors. The practices of security undertaken by the hydrocrats are classified as structural, institutional, and statutory acts. By focusing on practices of an epistemic community like hydrocrats, this paper addresses longstanding weaknesses of the securitisation theory of being elitist and ignoring the agency of mid-level bureaucrats. It also highlights the constructivist nature of international politics. The findings contribute empirically to securitisation theory’s ‘Paris School’ of thought."

Based on empirical data, this thesis demonstrates how the Indian hydrocracy securitises the governance of transboundary rivers and locates the role of international water law in the negotiations between India and Nepal.

They find that consumers who believe in personality stability (i.e., entity theorists) view anthropomorphized brands that undergo negative publicity less favorably than nonanthropomorphized brands. In contrast, consumers who advocate personality malleability (i.e., incremental theorists) are less likely to devalue an anthropomorphized brand from a single instance of negative publicity.

For this purpose we employ a micro-swimmer model composed of three arbitrarily-shaped rigid beads connected linearly by two springs. By analysing this swimmer in terms of the forces on the different beads, we determine the optimal kinematic parameters for sinusoidal driving, and also explain the pusher/puller nature of the swimmer.

This conflicting dependence of the swimming velocity on the viscosity is poorly understood theoretically. Here we explain that any mechanical microswimmer with an elastic degree of freedom in a simple Newtonian fluid can exhibit both kinds of response to an increase in the fluid viscosity for different viscosity ranges, if the driving is weak. The velocity response is controlled by a single parameter Γ, the ratio of the relaxation time of the elastic component of the swimmer in the viscous fluid and the swimming stroke period. This defines two velocity–viscosity regimes, which we characterize using the bead-spring microswimmer model and analyzing the different forces acting on the parts of this swimmer.

    "paper_abstract": "This article draws together two studies: one that explores the intimate relationships of young slum-dwelling Dalit women in Mumbai and the other of young middle-class women in Baroda, Gujarat. Using an intersectional lens, we trace the ways that gendered ideals of respectability shape women's freedom of movement and relationships. The comparison produces new insights into the ways that class, caste, and location cut across gender to shape young women's lives in India. We argue that the distinctive positionings of the women structure the ways in which they react to gender norms and the means with which they strategize around them. Middle-class young women strike a ‘passive bargain’, upholding ideals of respectability by shoring up symbolic capital for a ‘good’ marriage and class privilege. The Dalit women show more active resistance to an ideal that they struggle to achieve, despite heavy control and …"

Public action has the credit of transforming the Kerala society into a modern society (Ramachandran 1996). Mass actions of the public and progressive policy initiatives of governments were the main reasons behind the transformation. Dreze and Sen (1989: 225) argue that:The success of Kerala in achieving support-led security adds force to the plausi bility of following this route even when the economy is very poor. The fact that Kerala has achieved such success through careful and wide-coverage public support shows how much can be achieved even at a low level of income if pub He action is aimed at promoting people's basic entitlements and capabilities."

One of the important indicators that the index bases the ranking on is the level of violence against the journalists and their overall safety. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Indian government cracked down on the press by reprimanding any form of dissent regarding their policies. This has resulted in journalists from various parts of the country being arrested, detained, and harassed. The much-debated Epidemic Diseases Act of 1897 and Disaster Management Act, 2005 were implemented to invoke curbs to contain the spread of coronavirus in India.

Although low-frequency channels are better suited to measure the emission due to liquid associated with rain, most techniques to date rely on high-frequency, scattering-based schemes since the low-frequency methods are limited to the highly variable land surface background, whose radiometric contribution is substantial and can vary more than the contribution of the rain signal. Thus, emission techniques are generally useless over the majority of the Earth's surface. As a first step toward advancing to globally useful physical retrieval schemes, an intercomparison project was organized to determine the accuracy and variability of …"

The GPM mission strategy is to measure precipitation globally with high temporal resolution by using a constellation of satellite radiometers logically united by the GPM core satellite, which will be in a non-sun-synchronous medium inclination orbit. The usefulness of the combined product depends on the consistency of precipitation retrievals from the various microwave radiometers. The Tb calibration requirement to achieve such consistency demands first that Tb's from the individual radiometers be free of instrument and measurement artifacts and, second, that these self-consistent Tb's will be translated to a common standard (GPM core) for the unification of the precipitation retrieval …"

The bias is consistent with a source that generally cools during orbit night and warms during sunlight exposure. The likely primary source has been identified as a slightly emissive parabolic antenna reflector. This paper presents an empirical brightness temperature correction to TMI based on the position around each orbit and the Sun elevation above the orbit plane. The results of radiometric intercomparisons with WindSat and special sensor microwave imager are presented, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the recommended correction approach based on four years of data."

Characteristics and possible mechanisms behind low‐cloud formation in the summer monsoon season are presented. The dominant lower tropospheric circulation over the Arabian Sea during the summer season is the monsoon low‐level jet (LLJ). Low clouds are predominantly found on the exit portion of the LLJ with decelerating winds. We postulate that the moisture carried by the LLJ from the entrance region with accelerating winds converge at the exit region with decelerating winds. This low‐level convergence (observed ~925 hPa level) may be conducive for moisture convergence, parcel uplifting, and low‐cloud formation. These clouds are unable to grow vertically due to the presence of lower …"

The author demonstrates the upheaval that literary culture underwent as a new class of literati emerged: anthologists, critics, theatre makers, publishers and translators. These people participated in global conversations that left their mark on theory in the early twentieth century. Reading through archives and ephemera, Kedar Arun Kulkarni illustrates how literary cultures in colonised locales converged with and participated fully in key defining moments of world literature, but also diverged from them to create, simultaneously, a unique literary modernity."

This was the first popular theatre in western India, relying on a knowing audience who attended the theatre for the familiar plots that unfold through song and representation.

Players ably navigated the seas and took overland routes to distant locales; mobile performances ensured a steady circulation through various established theatrical circuits along which performers could gain a reputation, earn extra shekels in their pockets and also ‘see the world.’At the same time, this theatre left few remains: it was always on the go and lacked stable institutional centres.

The purpose of this research was to study the links between the use of video games and the consumption of various substances such as alcohol, tobacco or cannabis at adolescence. In order to do so, 1423 students from middle and high schools filled an auto-questionnaire that included questions on age, gender, year of study, use of video games and consumptions of alcohol (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test Short version, AUDIT-C), tobacco (Heaviness of Smoking Index, HSI), and cannabis (Cannabis Abuse Screening Test, CAST). We found that 92.1% of teens use video games and 17.7% have a problematic use of video games (PUVG). Furthermore, results show that substance consumption seems frequent with 19.8 and 8.3% of participants having hazardous alcohol and cannabis consumptions respectively and 5.2% having a moderate to high tobacco dependence. Video gamers consumed significantly more alcohol and gamers with PUVG started their substance consumption (alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis) earlier. PUVG was found to be negatively correlated to age at first substance consumption, but positively correlated to the time spent playing video games. However, it was not correlated to risks of substance dependence (scores of AUDIT-C, HSI, and CAST). Finally, our results are consistent with the literature, in regard to frequency of substance use and use of video games in adolescence.

It identifies four steps of a typical feature selection method, and categorizes the different existing methods in terms of generation procedures and evaluation functions, and reveals hitherto unattempted combinations of generation procedures and evaluation functions. Representative methods are chosen from each category for detailed explanation and discussion via example. Benchmark datasets with different characteristics are used for comparative study. The strengths and weaknesses of different methods are explained. Guidelines …"

    "paper_abstract": "Discrete values have important roles in data mining and knowledge discovery. They are about intervals of numbers which are more concise to represent and specify, easier to use and comprehend as they are closer to a knowledge-level representation than continuous values. Many studies show induction tasks can benefit from discretization: rules with discrete values are normally shorter and more understandable and discretization can lead to improved predictive accuracy. Furthermore, many induction algorithms found in the literature require discrete features. All these prompt researchers and practitioners to discretize continuous features before or during a machine learning or data mining task. There are numerous discretization methods available in the literature. It is time for us to examine these seemingly different methods for discretization and find out how different they really are, what are the key components of …"

    "paper_abstract": "Feature selection is an effective technique in dealing with dimensionality reduction. For classification, it is used to find an “optimal” subset of relevant features such that the overall accuracy of classification is increased while the data size is reduced and the comprehensibility is improved. Feature selection methods contain two important aspects: evaluation of a candidate feature subset and search through the feature space. Existing algorithms adopt various measures to evaluate the goodness of feature subsets. This work focuses on inconsistency measure according to which a feature subset is inconsistent if there exist at least two instances with same feature values but with different class labels. We compare inconsistency measure with other measures and study different search strategies such as exhaustive, complete, heuristic and random search, that can be applied to this measure. We conduct an empirical study …"

    "paper_abstract": "Processing applications with a large number of dimensions has been a challenge for the KDD community. Feature selection, an effective dimensionality reduction technique, is an essential pre-processing method to remove noisy features. In the literature only a few methods have been proposed for feature selection for clustering, and almost all these methods are 'wrapper' techniques that require a clustering algorithm to evaluate candidate feature subsets. The wrapper approach is largely unsuitable in real-world applications due to its heavy reliance on clustering algorithms that require parameters such as the number of clusters, and the lack of suitable clustering criteria to evaluate clustering in different subspaces. In this paper we propose a 'filter' method that is independent of any clustering algorithm. The proposed method is based on the observation that data with clusters has a very different point-to-point …"

It examines some fundamental questions: What is digital humanities? Who is a digital humanist? What is its place in the Indian context? The chapters in the volume:• study the varied practices and pedagogies involved in incorporating the ‘digital’into traditional classrooms;• showcase how researchers across disciplinary lines are expanding their scope of research, by adding a ‘digital’component to update their curriculum to contemporary times;• highlight how this has also created opportunities for researchers to push the boundaries of their pedagogy and encouraged students to create ‘live projects’ with the aid of digital platforms; and• track changes in the language of research, documentation, archiving and reproduction as new conversations are opening up across Indian languages. A major intervention in the social sciences and humanities, this book will be of great interest to scholars and researchers of media studies, especially new and digital media, education, South Asian studies and cultural studies."

    "paper_abstract": "The article examines the poetics of documenting dissent during the Emergency under Mrs. Indira Gandhi through two specific archives. The declaration of Emergency in a democracy attempts to cut down the very scale of political citizenship to which dissenting bodies seem to aspire. Historians of the Emergency have noted how the Indira-led-Congress systematically closed down all spaces of dissent. The texts used for this article are taken from either a particular archive which was inadvertently discovered by an Indian researcher in a US library, or from OV Vijayan’s doodles on the Emergency. As an Emergency veteran Makarand Desai claims, the truth had to be “smuggled” out of the Congress’ reach for it to be unearthed later. This “smuggling of dissent” occured either across physical spaces or in many cases within the text itself, hidden behind apparent innocuousness through sophisticated techniques. What were the forms of censorship and self-censorship adopted by these chroniclers of Emergency? What is the value of belated testimonies in recuperating what Desai calls “Truth”? And finally, one might wish to speculate over the extent to which the surveillance measures of the Emergency, and the subsequent regulated access to censored documents led to the shaping of the contemporary educated middle-class (readers) in India? This article will be an attempt to creatively read these two archives as modes of approaching the question of smothered dissent during the Emergency. Such a reading will interest scholars of visual and textual studies, as well as political theorists of the text."

However, the overwhelming majority of research taking an intersectional approach to date is hampered by limiting its analysis to the confines of any given country. Such “domestic intersectionality” does not reflect the growing transnationalization of people’s lives and family matters given that over 200 million people now live outside the nation where they were born. A key objective of this article is to make a case explicitly for broadening intersectional analyses to the transnational scale. Moreover, the article argues that feminist analysis of families is greatly enhanced when their standpoints are examined simultaneously at multiple social scales including the intimate, local, national and transnational scales.

    "paper_abstract": "Within the inclusive approach of mobility studies, migration has been referred to as one of the most prominent forms of mobility. However, discussing all migrants’ experiences as just “mobile” experiences shadows the range and nuances of migration. This paper argues and illustrates how migration can be a form of mobility and also addresses migration as a much nuanced form of mobility that has been rather silent in existing literature. We examine one social condition that has informed a range of international migrants’ experiences: their (re) organization of gender patterns within the family on the basis of transnational realities. We use a multi-scalar model of intersectionality to conceptualise migratory movements as mobility, particularly when the meaning is assigned to it on the basis of power relationships. This way, we suggest a fruitful intersectional analysis of migration and mobilities."

    "paper_abstract": "Since the inception of the intersectionality framework by feminists over three decades ago, scholars have advanced the analysis and subsequent understanding of peoples’ social locations, identity constructions, and systems of oppression involving gender, ethnicity, religion, class, and caste, to name a few. Considering these axes of differentiation as mutually constitutive rather than only as individual factors has been the single most important innovation. However, intersectionality has yet to reach its potential theoretically, methodologically, and practically. For instance, the framework is rarely applied to social phenomena that extend beyond the confines of a given nation-state. In previous publications, we have addressed this shortcoming by arguing for applying intersectionality across multiple social scales (intimate, regional, national, and transnational). We have shown how any given person’s intersectionality can and often does shift according to the scale of analysis. In this article, we address another important way to strengthen intersectionality—bringing in polyvocality. That is, and drawing upon arguments originally made in postmodern critiques of “writing culture”, publications tend to reflect partial and/or limited perspectives, typically those reflecting researchers’ privileged, authoritative accounts. In this article, in contrast, we include different insider (ego) and outsider (ego’s relatives’ and the researchers’) perspectives. The article includes the theoretical and methodological argument for adding polyvocality to intersectionality and then applies the proposed model to an ethnographic case. We illustrate how intersectional constellations shift from …"

However, creating an appropriate pricing strategy is crucial due to multiple costs, including logistics, refurbishment, and packaging for sustaining a CBM. This study gathered 3454 secondary data on refurbished smartphones from Indian e-commerce sellers, practicing the CBMs, recording features like release year, usage, memory, battery capacity, connectivity technology, weight, screen size, and price. Five features were engineered based on the data, and brand perception was analyzed to determine pricing. The top ten features were ranked based on feature contribution in classifier models trained as per the machine learning models, namely, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, and Neural Network.

It is not only just about getting healed but also the experience involved. This entails quality hospitality services in addition to medical services. Given that a happy employee provides better services, the role of job satisfaction of employees providing these services thus becomes important. Drawing from service quality frameworks, this article aims to identify enablers and deterrents of job satisfaction and validate with practitioners pulling out latent aspects that need to be focused on integrating hospitality in healthcare. We explored these aspects using a three-pronged approach. Initially, we identified the key themes influencing job satisfaction by applying data mining techniques to 13,000 employee reviews from companies recognized as Great Place to Work, sourced from Glassdoor.1 …"

Quantitative analysis based on a self-administered questionnaire and qualitative analysis based on open-ended questions using frequency distribut ion, word cloud, and sent imental analysis indicate that although employees have favored WFH practices due to flexibility in working hours and increased productivity in terms of personal and some work-related activities, factors like reduced coordination and virtual interactions account for the negative sentiments."

This study aimed to empirically examine how coworker support as a work event encourages employees’ knowledge contribution and knowledge-seeking behaviors through feelings of vitality. A structured, questionnaire-based survey was administered to 430 employees of knowledge-based organizations in India. The retrieved data were further analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results indicate that perceived coworker support positively influences the knowledge contribution and knowledge-seeking behavior of individuals in the workplace. Furthermore, vitality mediated the positive association between perceived coworker support and knowledge sharing. This implies that the perception of coworker support in the workplace augments employees’ feelings of vitality, which further motivates them to contribute to and seek knowledge from coworkers. Therefore, this study critically underscores the existence of a “performance loop” in knowledge sharing, as coworkers find it difficult to bypass an employee because of their outstanding performance and the fact that the same virtuous cycle elicits greater knowledge sharing by coworkers. Such perceived goodwill makes employees so good that they cannot be ignored within an organizational setting. This is a pioneering study investigating how coworker support in the workplace stimulates knowledge sharing among employees by considering the mediating effect of feelings of vitality.

Using census data, we find that villages with a higher share of marginalised castes viz. Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) have a lower probability of having public schools. The negative relationship is non-monotonic as the marginal probabilities get weaker beyond a threshold level of SC/ST share. Though the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (Education for All) programme, mainly intended to expand elementary education, has reduced the gaps in the provision of primary schools, the extent of discrimination has increased at the secondary level. A strong association between public schools and educational outcomes highlights the importance of public schools.

Exploiting the variation in the dominant social group in the village, we find a significant impact of village dominance. The reading and arithmetic skills of Scheduled Castes are better in their own castes-dominated villages compared to higher castes-dominated villages. Our findings show that village dominance affects learning outcomes primarily through differential teachers' behaviour. Children from marginalised castes are more likely to be scolded, beaten up, and treated unfairly by teachers in villages dominated by higher castes compared to their own castes. We do not find evidence of other mechanisms like the difference in parent and children's aspirations, caste diversity, discrimination in the village, or positive group externalities, which could explain why children from Scheduled Castes …"

Sexual pleasure with the colonized, racialized and gendered other is represented as a form of transgressing and transcending the limitations of the body that non-western and non-white bodies perpetually remain trapped in.

People around the world are urgently seeking sustainable ways of life for themselves and their communities. But what do these calls for a sustainable future mean for our current values and ways of life, and what kind of people will we need to become? Though sustainability is a ubiquitous concept with a range of meaning and applications, this volume shows that it can be significantly understood and sought through the notion of virtue, in the tradition of virtue ethics. Approaches to ethical living that emphasize good character and virtue are resurgent, and especially well-suited to addressing our present challenges. From rethinking excessive consumption, to appropriately respecting nature, to finding resilience in the face of environmental injustice, our characters will be frequently tested. The virtues of sustainability--character traits enabling us to lead sustainable, flourishing lives--will be critical to our success. This volume, divided into three sections, brings together newly-commissioned essays by leading scholars from multiple disciplines--from philosophy and political science, to religious studies and psychology. The essays in the first section focus on key factors and structures that support the cultivation of the virtues of sustainability, while those in the second focus in particular on virtues embraced by non-Western communities and cultures, and the worldviews that underlie them.

This research studies the working from home aspects faced by working people which has now penetrated in personal and professional spaces, in this phase of pandemic. Even those who were previously sceptical about achieving efficiency in distributed teams are now embracing it as a new way of working. Up grading and making use of digital platforms to stay connected. The more self-awareness needs about work style, find ways to work smarter, not harder. Perhaps it is time that the expression „work-life balance‟ is laid to rest, and, in its place, we use the term „work-life integration.‟ People who make this transition may well find that their resilience is strengthened because the mindset is about accepting and incorporating multiple demands upon our time and talents, between work, health, responsibility and family."

A powerful new stimulant of urbanization in the Global South, including India is its growing intersection with the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) revolution. The powerful paradigm of “Smart Cities” with its heavy techno-infrastructural focus has been advanced by proponents as a solution to enable rapid and efficient urbanization and to successfully deal with the challenges that come with it. ICT is accorded an important role in the very definition of the smart city, understood as a “city in which Information and Communication Technology is merged with traditional infrastructures, coordinated and integrated using new digital technologies”(Batty et al., 2012, p. 481). This has created a new form of digital citizenship, accompanied by claims of newer and more easily deployable opportunities for citizen engagement and participation. At the same time, the smart city also risks creating a technocratic state with growing concerns regarding citizen inclusion in governance, privacy, and surveillance. This chapter attempts to examine the smart city paradigm’s particular understanding of urbanization, the way it has manifested in India and the peculiar kind of top-down, citizen engagement it has fostered."

In this position paper, we discuss challenges and opportunities that generative AI technologies pose for novices' self-regulation strategies in the context of programming problem solving. We believe that the key challenge facing educators is that such technologies may hamper novices' ability to regulate their programming problem solving process.On the other hand, these technologies also open up the possibility to design …"

To reduce this effort, prior work has investigated the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 to generate explanations. Unfortunately, these explanations can be incomplete or incorrect, and therefore unhelpful if presented to students directly. Nevertheless, LLM-generated explanations may be of adequate quality for Teaching Assistants (TAs) to efficiently craft helpful explanations on their basis.

    "paper_abstract": "Against philosophical orthodoxy, Hilary Kornblith has mounted an empirically grounded critique of the epistemic value of reflection. In this paper, I argue that this recent critique of the epistemic value of reflection fails even if we concede that (a) the empirical facts are as Kornblith says they are and (b) reliability is the only determinant of epistemic value. The critique fails because it seeks to undermine the reliability of reflection in general but targets only one of its variants, namely individual reflection, while neglecting social reflection. This critique comprises two arguments which have a common structure: they both impose a requirement on the reliability of reflection, but deny, on empirical grounds, that the requirement is met. One argument imposes an introspection requirement, which I reject as superfluous. I show how reflection can proceed without introspection. The other argument imposes an efficacy requirement. This requirement concerns whether reflection is causally efficacious ie, whether it leads us to change our minds for the better. I accept this as a genuine requirement. Even if we concede that individual reflection fails to meet this requirement, I argue that we have not been given sufficient evidence to believe that social reflection is bound to fail this requirement. Furthermore, my analysis of the conditions under which social reflection works best provides us with prima facie grounds for optimism regarding the reliability of social reflection. Ultimately, then, these arguments fail to undermine the epistemic value of reflection in general."

Epistemologists have levelled two sorts of criticisms: first, they point out that Radford’s case isn’ta clear case of knowledge; second, they object that even if knowledge is granted in Radford-like cases, agents therein will still have dispositional belief. This paper offers a case that improves upon Radford’s. In my case, the agent’s evidence is intuitively sufficient for knowledge. And we do not need to posit dispositional belief to make the case empirically plausible. My counterexample involves a distinctive type of agent: cautious believers. Cautious believers care more about avoiding false belief. When armed with evidence that is sufficient-though only barely sufficient-to justify some proposition p, cautious believers suspend judgment about p. Nevertheless, they remain minimally behaviourally sensitive to the evidence. Ultimately, I argue that such agents are in a mental state that falls short of belief."

Of the number of factors attributed to this decline, habitat fragmentation has been the most worrisome. Wildlife corridors have long been a subject of discussion amongst wildlife biologists and conservationists with contrasting schools of thought arguing their merits and demerits. However, it is largely believed that wildlife corridors can help minimize genetic isolation, offset fragmentation problems, improve animal dispersal, restore ecological processes and reduce man animal conflict. This study attempted to evaluate the possibilities of identifying a suitable wildlife corridor between two very important wildlife areas of central India – the Kanha National Park and the Pench National Park – with tiger as the focal species. Geographic Information System (GIS) centric Least Cost Path modeling was used to identify likely routes for movement of tigers. Habitat suitability, perennial water bodies, road density, railway tracks, human settlement density and total forest edge were considered as key variables influencing tiger movement across the Kanha-Pench landscape. Each of these variables was weighted in terms of relative importance through an expert consultation process. Using different importance scenarios, three alternate corridor routes were generated of which one was identified as the most promising for tiger dispersal. Weak links – where cover and habitat conditions are currently sub-optimal – were flagged on the corridor route. Interventions aimed at augmenting the identified corridor route have been suggested using accepted wildlife corridor …"

My first chapter deals with both authors’ interrogation of nationalist responses to creative production; and the second with the creative process. I argue that the nationalist mind-set is bound up with their collaboration—the English translation of Gitanjali—and it is this which establishes their entry into transnationality. Despite their determined transnationalism, however, I contend that neither author is free of the nationalism that was a significant part of their contemporary period and their personal histories.       The next three chapters examine this concern with production of art and identity through a fraught nationalist approach as it manifests in the primary social unit — the family. Examining the female voice, the male construction of home and the child, I argue that Yeats and Tagore are invested with reconstructing social systems and in making the poet-hero preeminent in their new literary models. Their concern with identity and creativity manifests itself in the form of lineage and inheritance. Finally, I argue that Tagore imagines an articulate poet child as his successor while Yeats establishes creative productions themselves as his …"

Most pertinently, there has been criticism about the disproportionate number of Nobel laureates writing in dominant languages (English, French, German, Spanish), the role of the Nobel in world literature, the dearth of awardees from the Global South, its resistance to women writers, internal conflicts and political agendas that might influence decisions, and so on. Critics argue that the Nobel Prize in Literature remains more vulnerable than the other Nobel Prizes to sins of omission, especially evident in its historical neglect of key modernist figures such as Henrik Ibsen, Marcel Proust, James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, and Jorge Luis Borges.

Majumdar’s book highlights the larger conceptual pitfalls that pervade postcolonial theory and determines how they may be overcome using the radical political attentiveness that Gopal reintroduced to historicism; it is a timely and useful intervention. Majumdar demonstrates that such radicalism is often missing in prominent postcolonial literary criticism and powerfully redresses this oversight using a distinctly Marxist lens for her sharp literary analyses. Majumdar opens the monograph by recognizing the evolution and increasingly wide applications of postcolonial theory beyond English studies and considering the central concerns of postcolonial theory and the challenges with which it must contend in the social sciences and cultural studies.

In fact, the influence of other cinemas on Bombay films was reflected narratively and in other aspects of filmmaking such as fashion, poster art etc. Thus, at the center of this debate was the issue of Bombay cinema's identity as a bastardized clone of Hollywood and the counter argument that noted the distinctiveness of Bombay film culture by highlighting the “difference” in the manner of production.In view of these unacknowledged networks of exchange, the term “remake” was often used within popular discourse as an underhanded accusation of plagiarism against Bombay films. Moreover, because most of Bombay cinema’s remakes of Hollywood films were un-credited, they never secured the legitimacy attained in Hollywood and world cinemas wherein this process was seen as a reinterpretation of an earlier work or an updated modus operandi. For the most part, Bombay films were at best seen as a cinema of hybrid genres characterised by the centrality of a love story, high use of melodrama, stock characters, the insertion of song-and-dance routines and a happy ending.

Apart from examining the validity of the theory and policy framework underlying the economic reforms in India, the book examines in depth the interpretation and implementation of this framework in Gujarat and studies the inclusiveness of the growth in terms of achieving development goals. This book goes much beyond the state-level analysis. It studies the role of the Gujarat economy in the context of the national economy as well as in comparison with the performance of other states' economies. Further, it analyses the dynamics of growth in the state, that is, the sources and process of growth, sustainability of growth, and its interaction with development goals. The book also highlights the growing disconnect between economic growth and development goals in Gujarat. Although there are some limitations of the neo-liberal policy framework in delivering inclusive growth, the focus of Gujarat on becoming the fastest growing state in the world and the most attractive destination for corporate investments has led the state government to make serious compromises with respect to development goals. In spite of being one of the fastest growing states, therefore, the state is lagging behind other fast-growing as well as slow-growing states in achieving inclusive growth.

However, we argue that a strict duality of definitions hides the core characteristics and insecurity faced by the workers. While each of these perspectives reflects one or the other part of the informal economy, a recent view is that it is much more heterogeneous and complex than a sum of these parts (www. wiego. org). While the dualistic definition of the informal sector is useful to emphasise the stark contrast, two nuances have been added to the debate. First, there are strong inter-linkages between the formal and informal sectors, and second, there is more of a continuum of employment relationships in the economy rather than a dualistic structure.

This note describes the construction of quantitative indices measuring the quality of statebusiness relations (SBRs) across Indian states in the 1975-2008 period. It represents the first effort to systematically characterise SBRs across sub-national units within a country without resorting to subjective surveys. This poses specific methodological challenges and encourages us to use a number of different variables (both from secondary and primary sources) to quantify the magnitude of effectiveness of SBRs. We discuss the possible sensitivity of the indices to minor and major definitional changes and examine the evolution of SBRs across Indian states and at the national level through the study of cross sectional and secular trends in these indices. The results suggest that the intensity of statebusiness relations, a measure of the positive impact of these on business sector, correlates with economic growth, although this does not imply causation. Further, state-business relations have improved over time in all states barring Bihar. Rankings of states in terms of the SBR index show varying time trends–stable and high ranking for Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu indicates, a stable and low ranking for Uttar Pradesh and Assam, rapidly improving for Haryana, Rajasthan and Orissa and swift deterioration for West Bengal, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh."

Innovation in the payment system can potentially impact output, prices, and monetary policy transmissions.

This paper examines the dynamic linkage between a digital payment system, real-time gross settlement (RTGS), and economic growth in India, using a multivariate Bayesian vector autoregressive (BVAR) model. Using monthly observations on the value and the volume of RTGS, we show that the value of RTGS has a significant impact on both income and price level in the economy. Our results also indicate that both RTGS and economic growth positively and significantly impact each other, supporting the existence of bidirectional causality between the two. A variance decomposition analysis confirms that both RTGS and economic activity contribute significantly to each other's fluctuations. Several sensitivity analyses reinforce our main findings."

For this study, we have selected two cross-sectional samples comprising 360 non-financial firms listed on National Stock Exchange (NSE)—divided into 183 small firms and 177 large firms—for the financial year 2019–2020 and 2020–2021. The classification between large and small firms is drawn based on the respective quartile values of total assets and market capitalization taken together. The proxy for agency cost is the natural logarithm of selling and distribution expenses. We have developed an index using the count of characters, words, lines, and pages of the annual report to measure readability. To investigate the association between the annual report readability, agency cost, and firm size, we use the OLS methodology. In our model, we control for fixed assets …"

    "paper_abstract": "Global megacities are rapidly transforming through slum redevelopment and alternative resettlements of evicted poor. Resettlement is broadly seen as enabling, a basis of improved housing and even a pathway towards urban citizenship. This article offers an alternative perspective on urban resettlement, whereby the urban poor are subjected to life-threatening housing interventions. It builds on Mbembe's (2003) 'necropolitics' through an ethnographic study of Mumbai's Mahul case to theorise state powers in unleashing life-threatening housing circumstances. In doing so, this article introduces the concept of necrosettlements to account for the particularity of necropolitical-economy, material reality, unfolding subjectivities, and political possibility of life-threatening settlements. First, it theorises a political economy that extracts economic surplus and creates urban growth from poor-exclusive housing in uninhabitable …"

Based on an empirical study of an NGO (SPARC)-mediated resettlement of Project Affected Persons (PAPs) in Mumbai, it explicates the incomplete ‘civilizing of the political society’ which engenders asymmetrical material and leadership enablement and differential subjectivities at the community levels. The state co-opts SPARC’s institutional framework to mediate resettlement, engender limited traversal from ‘population’ to ‘citizen’, restrict democratic liberation and subject the PAPs to bifold governance against the antagonistic articulations of state-subaltern relations, viz. ‘political society’ and ‘deep democracy’. SPARC’s institutional claims of inclusion and community-centric resettlement, non-confrontational negotiations and politics of patience are materialized through …"

    "paper_abstract": "This dissertation concerns capitalist urban redevelopment and the government of urban housing poverty. It examines the ways urban redevelopment regimes shape resettlements and governance of urban populations in Mumbai. The specific enquiries focus on salient accumulative and dispossessive dimensions of urban redevelopment and linked resettlement construction, the reformation of informal politics of the poor, and possibilities of reordering renewal and resettlement governance processes. These enquiries are addressed through an ethnographic exploration of two mega-projects: transport expansion and pipeline securitization, two resettlement townships, and their multi-scalar and multi-site sociopolitical dynamisms. The theoretical framework of “redevelopment as governmentality” guides analysis connecting macro-institutional practices and their human consequences.This is a compilation dissertation with a Kappa (comprehensive discussion) and four sole-authored journal articles. The dissertation makes four major contributions: First, urban redevelopment regimes employ an extractive-inclusive political economy in resettlement housing developments, which promotes urban growth. This is beyond facilitative or welfarist rehousing linked with displacement-based dispossession. The underlying political-economic logics, and institutional and policy frameworks also shape the life-allowing and limiting materiality of resettlement. Second, state and NGO-mediated resettlements employ unconditional urban displacements through strategies that speak of institutional violence, coercion, and abandonment, but are coated with the hope of …"

Scholarship must also adapt to these evolving issues by developing new practices and generating relevant scholarship. This article examines a case of ‘social extremis’—severe socio-political conditions that threaten or limit life—and explores social practices that challenge such conditions. The study focuses on a city-wide redevelopment project in Mumbai and the subsequent resettlement policy for displaced populations in industrial, environmentally hazardous peripheries. Based on extensive fieldwork, including over 100 interviews, extended community participation, and institutional document analysis, the article argues that neoliberal welfare regimes, while aiming to address housing inequality, resulted in life-threatening (necropolitical) consequences through inclusionary housing policies.

In particular, the activities of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women and the ILO Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations are reviewed. In the paragraphs that follow, the national legislation and case-laws are examined. Furthermore, the reasons for the persistent gender stereotypes in the labor market, as well as the general attitude toward women’s roles in society in each country are reviewed. The authors identify the obstacles to achieving true gender equality in the workplace and formulate recommendations for improving protections against discrimination of women in employment as well as ensuring equal access to employment and promotion."

BSE index is above 24000+ points and picking stocks at this level is a risky business. Most of the investors and fund managers believe in picking stocks which are relatively cheaper than the industry average and therefore PE ratio would play an important role.

Secondly, in what way can this case further our understanding of securitisation and thus contribute to the development of the theory? In this article, I have argued that, much like a two-act play, India's securitisation of the Pakistani threat occurred in two distinct (speech) acts. The first illocutionary move preceded the extraordinary measure of Indian troops crossing the Line of Control separating Indian- and Pakistani-administered Jammu and Kashmir.

Drawing on interviews with journalists, diplomats, academics, military officers, and government officials, it argues that it is Pakistanis who have borne the brunt of terrorist violence, especially since 9/11. The book uses the English School of International Relations’ concept of great power responsibility to explore how powerful states could help fight militancy in Pakistan holistically. It highlights the Pakistani military’s effort to rehabilitate young militants, and posits that international society must support not only “hard” counterterrorism through military aid, but also “soft” counterterrorism such as rehabilitation to address the root causes of radicalisation. With the Trump administration’s suspension of military aid to Pakistan, this timely book offers guidance for policymakers in both the West and Asia on how best to approach Pakistan’s security quagmire."

Taking into account the various changes that the internet and cloud computing has introduced in the organizational systems and processes across the globe, it is prudent to understand the relationship between leadership and digitalization to foresee how leaders should prepare themselves to cater to the challenges of the future. Leadership is indeed an ever-evolving concept, and so is technology; of which digitalization is an outcome. Most inquiries about such a relation are being well executed by the western cultures.

    "paper_abstract": "The issue of work-life balance is becoming increasingly important for employers and employees globally. The clearer becomes our understanding about this issue; the better it will be for an effective and positive integration of these dynamic domains of our lives. Work-family enrichment is a positive way of integrating work and family and it helps to achieve work-life balance. In this Indo-German study, work-life balance, work-family enrichment, work-family culture and career success are analysed on a cross-cultural level using quantitative as well as qualitative methods. The findings uncovered the similarities and differences that lie between Germany & India; which give insights into (a) the enriching experiences related to work-family (b) career success and (c) work-life balance related aspects of German and Indian managers. A few gender differences were observed when the data for both countries was analysed collectively. The results partially support a relationship between work-life balance & career success as well as a relationship between work-family enrichment/family-work enrichment & career success."

Grain and straw yields of rice with 60 kg N/ha after green manuring were slightly greater than with 120 kg N/ha after summer fallow.

Using very simple rules for forming such preferred degree networks, we find some unusual statistical properties not found in familiar Erdös-Rényi or scale free networks. By letting depend on the fraction of infected individuals, we model the behavioral changes in response to how the extent of the epidemic is perceived. In our models, the behavioral adaptations can be either ‘blind’or ‘selective’–depending on whether a node adapts by cutting or adding links to randomly chosen partners or selectively, based on the state of the partner. For a frozen preferred network, we find that the infection threshold follows the heterogeneous mean field result and the phase diagram matches the predictions of the annealed adjacency matrix (AAM) approach. With ‘blind’adaptations, although the epidemic threshold remains unchanged, the infection level is substantially affected, depending on the details of the adaptation. The ‘selective’adaptive SIS models are most interesting. Both the threshold and the level of infection changes, controlled not only by how the adaptations are implemented but also how often the nodes cut/add links (compared to the time scales of the epidemic spreading). A simple mean field theory is presented for the selective adaptations which capture the qualitative and some of the quantitative features of the infection phase diagram."

We explain this insensitivity as arising from the fact that the energy at maximum spectral weight continues to show an almost linear behavior up to fairly high energies.

The claim is validated using a channel flow setup by showing the agreement of mass flux with analytical value.

Unfortunately, most of the existing models are either too fine-grained to be efficient or too coarse-grained to be reliable. Here we propose a computationally efficient hybrid approach that uses SIR model for individual cities which are in turn coupled via empirical transportation networks that facilitate migration among them. The treatment presented here differs from existing models in two crucial ways: first, self-consistent determination of coupling parameters so as to maintain the populations of individual cities, and second, the incorporation of distance dependent temporal delays in migration. We apply our model to Indian aviation as well as railway networks taking into account populations of more than 300 cities. Our results project that through the domestic transportation, the significant population is poised to be exposed within 90 days of the onset of epidemic. Thus, serious supervision of domestic transport networks is warranted even after restricting international migration."

Here, we use a 9-component, age-stratified, contact-structured epidemiological compartmental model, which we call the INDSCI-SIM model, to analyse the first wave of COVID-19 spread in India. We use INDSCI-SIM, together with Bayesian methods, to obtain optimal fits to daily reported cases and deaths across the span of the first wave of the Indian pandemic, over the period Jan 30, 2020 to Feb 15, 2021. We account for lock-downs and other non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), an overall increase in testing as a function of time, the under-counting of cases and deaths, and a range of age-specific infection-fatality ratios. We first use our model to describe data from all individual districts of the state of Karnataka, benchmarking our calculations using data from serological surveys. We then extend this approach to aggregated data for Karnataka state. We model the progress of the pandemic across the cities of Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Bengaluru and Chennai, and then for India as a whole. We estimate that deaths were undercounted by a factor between 2 and 5 across the span of the first wave, converging on 2.2 as a representative multiplier that accounts for the urban-rural gradient. We also estimate an overall under-counting of cases by a factor of between 20 and 25 towards the end of the first wave.

    "paper_abstract": "The following paper establishes a measurement of social identity uncertainty. Based on uncertainty-identity theory, we propose social identity uncertainty is a unique type of self-uncertainty related to group identification. We further believe social identity uncertainty is comprised of two components: identity-uncertainty (i.e., uncertainty about one’s group identity) and membership-uncertainty (i.e., uncertainty about being a group member). Study 1 (N = 314) and Study 2 (N = 299) explored and confirmed that two subcomponents exist within social identity uncertainty. Study 3 (N = 295) developed convergent validity using various social identity-related constructs, and discriminant validity using dispositional constructs. Overall, we found (a) identity-uncertainty and membership-uncertainty are distinct constructs, and (b) our measurements have both convergent and discriminant validity."

This article investigates how the communication of such claims impacts third‐party perceptions of the group's structure and future actions. Two experiments explored the underlying processes that shape such third‐party perceptions. Study 1 (N = 86) showed that victim‐claiming groups were perceived as more uncertain than groups not claiming victimhood and as a result as less entitative units. Study 2 (N = 165) showed that victimhood‐claiming groups’ intentions toward violent and retributive acts were legitimized by observers through perceptions of heightened uncertainty. Claims of collective victimhood help groups justify the adoption of a violent strategy against an antagonistic outgroup through perceived heightened uncertainty.

This chapter discusses collective violence as a systematically orchestrated act that is led by influential in-group sources, such as leaders, against clearly defined enemies. Social identity theory began and was conceived as a theory of intergroup relations to explain conflict and cooperation between groups. Social identity theory explicates why people join groups and the meaning of social categories to individuals who identify with them. Leaders are a source of in-group influence and a galvanizing force within groups. A similar identity trap is the tendency of groups to view themselves as the sole victims in conflict and the other group as the …"

    "paper_abstract": "With the ongoing demographic and epidemiological transition, cancer is emerging as a major public health concern in India. This paper uses nationally representative household survey to examine the overall prevalence and economic burden of cancer in India. The age-standardized prevalence of cancer is estimated to be 97 per 100,000 persons with greater prevalence in urban areas. The evidence suggests that cancer prevalence is highest among the elderly and also among females in the reproductive age groups. Cancer displays a significant socioeconomic gradient even after adjusting for age-sex specifics and clustering in a multilevel regression framework. We find that out of pocket expenditure on cancer treatment is among the highest for any ailment. The average out of pocket spending on inpatient care in private facilities is about three-times that of public facilities. Furthermore, treatment for about 40 percent of cancer hospitalization cases is financed mainly through borrowings, sale of assets and contributions from friends and relatives. Also, over 60 percent of the households who seek care from the private sector incur out of pocket expenditure in excess of 20 percent of their annual per capita household expenditure. Given the catastrophic implications, this study calls for a disease-based approach towards financing such high-cost ailment. It is suggested that universal cancer care insurance should be envisaged and combined with existing accident and life insurance policies for the poorer sections in India. In concluding, we call for policies to improve cancer survivorship through effective prevention and early detection. In particular …"

We adopt a gender lens and present a disaggregated view of age-sex specific COVID-19 infection and mortality risk in India.MethodsWe use crowdsourced data (https://www. covid19india. org/) to provide preliminary estimates for age-sex specific COVID-19 case fatality rate (CFR) for India. We analyse the burden of the cases and deaths for age-sex categories. CFR is estimated as the ratio of confirmed deaths in total confirmed cases. We report binomial confidence interval for the CFR estimates. Also, an adjusted-CFR is developed to capture the potential mortality among the currently active infections.ResultsAs of May 20, 2020, males share a higher burden (66%) of COVID-19 infections than females (34%) but the infection is more or less evenly distributed in under-five as well as elderly age groups. The CFR among males and females is 2.9% and 3.3%, respectively. The age-specific COVID-19 CFR assumes ‘Nike-swoosh’pattern with elevated risks among the elderly. The World Health Organization world standard population structure standardized CFR for India is 3.34%.

The identified variables are then modelled into a hierarchical framework using Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) methodology to develop a contextual interrelationship among them. Based on extensive literature review and experts‟ opinions, the study identifies variables pertaining to the adoption behaviour of AI-based conversational agents. The study proposes a dual approach to establish and explain the behavioural reasons and causal relationship that exists among the identified variables. First, the study employs ISM methodology to examine the interrelationship among the identified fundamental variables, which results in a digraph specifying hierarchical levels. Second, MICMAC analysis has been performed to categorise the corresponding variables based on driving power and dependence power. The six-layered interpretive structural model reveals that social influence plays a pivotal role in the adoption phenomenon. The model further demonstrates that perceived anthropomorphism, perceived intelligence, and perceived personalisation are major drivers for the evaluation of functionality and value of conversational agents. Additionally, MICMAC analysis shows three distinct clusters in which variables are classified based on dependence powers and driving power. The foremost contribution of the current research is the development of the hierarchical model of the variables that shape the adoption decision.

We address this intellectual and policy neglect by reviewing the social, psychological and legal challenges governing the lives of people living with epilepsy (PWE) by paying particular attention to negotiations in arranged marriages and employment. Drawing on the analytical frameworks of the sociological study of stigma, critical race theory and paying attention to the cultural models of health and suffering, this study utilized a combination of (online) survey data (N = 100) and in-depth qualitative interviews (N = 10) with PWE and their families. The online survey was administered to map the level of awareness about epilepsy and its clinical management among the general population, whereas the in-depth interviews were conducted to understand the experience, self-perception and everyday struggles of those diagnosed with the condition. Findings from the survey on non-PWE suggest a general lack of awareness and fearful misconceptions around epilepsy related seizures. In-depth interviews with PWEs revealed concealment (of the illness) as a dominant coping strategy to attenuate the social alienation and rejection associated with epilepsy. Further, PWE participants reported persistent discrimination, harassment and prejudiced understanding of diminished cognitive capacities at workplaces as a result of cultural myths and popular representations of epilepsy-related seizures.

The goals of this study were twofold: (1) to offer an empirical examination of the household level empowerment measure through the theoretical construct of self-compassion and investigate its association with antenatal health, and (2) to ensure robust psychometric quality for this new measure. Drawing data from the nationally representative, multi-topic dataset of 42, 152 households, India Human Development Survey, IHDS II (2011–2012), the study performed a confirmatory factor analysis followed by an OLS estimation to investigate the association between a self-compassionate based empowerment and antenatal care. Empowerment was shown to be positively and significantly associated with antenatal care with significant age and education gradient.

I argue that with rising affluence and demographic aging, India is poised to experience an emergent cultural movement, the Third Age (Laslett, 1989), wherein access to cultural capital and an active participation in a leisure culture will offer social membership among upper middle class older adults. Using examples from luxury senior housing projects and travel/holiday packages, I reflect how this process of agentic consumerism with a focus on the ideals of youthfulness, choice, self-expression and pleasure is turning the decline narrative (typically associated with “natural” aging) on its head. The success of this market-driven cultural model, I argue, lies in the celebration of a project on the self where the responsibility to “age well” rests with the individual-a key political economy of the neoliberal regime-absolving the state of public provisions and social security. In conclusion, I show how age and political masculinity intersect to create, what I call, Brand Modi-a potent vision of active and ageambiguous consumer citizenry. Through this construction, I argue, life-stage has been suitably marketed to match the aspirations of a greying cohort marking a new stage in the cultural constitution of age in urban India."

    "paper_abstract": "Many of the most interesting complex media are non-Newtonian and exhibit time-dependent behavior of thixotropy and rheopecty. They may also have temporal responses described by power laws. The material behavior is represented by the relaxation modulus and the creep compliance. On the one hand, it is shown that in the special case of a Maxwell model characterized by a linearly time-varying viscosity, the medium's relaxation modulus is a power law which is similar to that of a fractional derivative element often called a springpot. On the other hand, the creep compliance of the time-varying Maxwell model is identified as Lomnitz's logarithmic creep law, making this possibly its first direct derivation. In this way both fractional derivatives and Lomnitz's creep law are linked to time-varying viscosity. A mechanism which yields fractional viscoelasticity and logarithmic creep behavior has therefore been found …"

Am. 108, 2796–2815 (2000)] is identified as the property of rheopecty. The property corresponds to a rare type of a non-Newtonian fluid in rheology which has largely remained unexplored. The material impulse response function from the GS model is found to be similar to the power-law memory kernel which is inherent in the framework of fractional calculus. The compressional wave equation and the shear wave equation derived from the GS model are shown to take the form of the Kelvin-Voigt fractional-derivative wave equation and the fractional diffusion-wave equation, respectively. Therefore, an analogy is drawn between the dispersion relations obtained from the fractional framework and those from the GS model to establish the equivalence of the respective wave …"

    "paper_abstract": "Most of the current applications of acoustic cavitation use bubble clusters that exhibit multibubble dynamics. This necessitates a complete understanding of the mutual nonlinear coupling between individual bubbles. In this study, strong nonlinear coupling is investigated in bubble pairs which is the simplest case of a bubble-cluster. This leads to the derivation of a more comprehensive set of coupled Keller-Miksis equations (KMEs) that contain nonlinear coupling terms of higher order. The governing KMEs take into account the convective contribution that stems from the Navier-Stokes equation. The system of KMEs is numerically solved for acoustically excited bubble pairs. It is shown that the higher-order corrections are important in the estimation of secondary Bjerknes force for closely spaced bubbles. Further, asymmetricity is witnessed in both magnitude and sign reversal of the secondary Bjerknes force in weak …"

Interestingly, the Curie–von Schweidler law is the motivation behind an unconventional circuit component called fractional capacitor which due to its power-law property is extensively used in the modeling of complex dielectric media. Unfortunately, the empirical nature of the Curie–von Schweidler law plagues the applications of the fractional capacitor. Here, we derive the Curie–von Schweidler law from a series combination of a resistor and a capacitor with a linear time-varying capacitance. This may possibly be its first derivation from physical principles. However, this required a modification of the classical charge–voltage relation of a capacitor to account for the time-varying capacitance. The limitation of the classical charge–voltage relation and its subsequent modification are justified using …"

The measure of the interaction is given by the attenuation kernel present in the constitutive stress-strain relation of the bar, which follows from the Kröner-Eringen’s model of nonlocal elasticity. We employ a fractional power-law attenuation kernel and spatially temper it, to make the model physically valid and mathematically consistent. The spatial dispersion relation is derived, but it turns out to be difficult to solve, both analytically and numerically. Consequently, we use numerical techniques to extract the real and imaginary parts of the complex wavenumber for a wide range of frequency values. From the dispersion plots, it is found that the phase velocity dispersion of elastic waves in the tempered nonlocal elastic bar is …"

The paper uses the Habermasian public sphere, Kellner’s media culture and Gaonkar’s ideas of alternative modernities to analyse the magazine. Magazines like Filmindia constituted literary public spheres which became a site for deliberation on defining the ideals of masculinity and femininity for the new nation. By virtue of being the most influential magazine of the time, Filmindia’s views also gain significance in constructing gender role models for the new nation. Filmindia, in its construction of the ideal man and woman, promotes societal modernization but opposes cultural modernization. The cultural core was to be protected and cinema with its ability to influence the masses posed a threat to it. Thus censorship becomes a tool to enforce the gender norms defined for the nation."

    "paper_abstract": "Most film historiography has originated from the urban centers of Bombay, Madras, Calcutta and Lahore. Recent scholarship has looked at smaller cities such as Pune and Kolhapur. In all these histories, details of film production happening in a city like Hyderabad are a curious absence that could be attributed to a multiplicity of reasons; for instance, the prominence of film production in the aforementioned cities and the availability of archival evidence. Focusing on film practices in cities such as Hyderabad presents the possibility of bringing alternative histories to the fore, which enhances the understanding of cinema as a complex network. Hyderabad has historically been distinct as a princely city under the rule of the Nizam, unlike the colonial cities of Madras, Calcutta, Bombay and Lahore. The study of early film history in Hyderabad then becomes a way to understand the social history of the place itself. This article attempts to trace the history of early film production in Hyderabad state by examining the case of Dhirendranath Ganguly who ran the Lotus Film Company in Hyderabad from 1922 to 1924. The case emerges as a site to investigate the networks of patronage specific to the princely city of Hyderabad, the industrial relations within which cinema operated and also the politics of film historiography after the linguistic re-organization of the Southern states of India starting in 1956. The fragmentary evidence of Ganguly’s company points out that he operated as an artist-entrepreneur in the Nizam state and further gives us insights into the socio-cultural milieu of Hyderabad city in the 1920s."

This factor is not fully explored yet. Tacit (idiosyncratic, inarticulate, nonconscious) knowledge is acquired personally through experience and cannot be transferred or conveyed to anyone. This is the knowledge we use to act without knowing it in a propositional form. We present the case of one of India’s largest informal footwear cluster, located in the city of Agra.

    "paper_abstract": "A book that lays out the fundamental concepts of design culture and outlines a design-driven way to approach the world. Humans did not discover fire—they designed it. Design is not defined by software programs, blueprints, or font choice. When we create new things—technologies, organizations, processes, systems, environments, ways of thinking—we engage in design. With this expansive view of design as their premise, in The Design Way Harold Nelson and Erik Stolterman make the case for design as its own culture of inquiry and action. They offer not a recipe for design practice or theorizing but a formulation of design culture's fundamental core of ideas. These ideas—which form “the design way”—are applicable to an infinite variety of design domains, from such traditional fields as architecture and graphic design to such nontraditional design areas as organizational, educational, interaction, and healthcare design. The text of this second edition is accompanied by new detailed images,“schemas” that visualize, conceptualize, and structure the authors' understanding of design inquiry. The text itself has been revised and expanded throughout, in part in response to reader feedback."

    "paper_abstract": "The authors of Thoughtful Interaction Design go beyond the usual technical concerns of usability and usefulness to consider interaction design from a design perspective. The shaping of digital artifacts is a design process that influences the form and functions of workplaces, schools, communication, and culture; the successful interaction designer must use both ethical and aesthetic judgment to create designs that are appropriate to a given environment. This book is not a how-to manual, but a collection of tools for thought about interaction design. Working with information technology—called by the authors\" the material without qualities\"—interaction designers create not a static object but a dynamic pattern of interactivity. The design vision is closely linked to context and not simply focused on the technology. The authors' action-oriented and context-dependent design theory, drawing on design theorist Donald Schön's concept of the reflective practitioner, helps designers deal with complex design challenges created by new technology and new knowledge. Their approach, based on a foundation of thoughtfulness that acknowledges the designer's responsibility not only for the functional qualities of the design product but for the ethical and aesthetic qualities as well, fills the need for a theory of interaction design that can increase and nurture design knowledge. From this perspective they address the fundamental question of what kind of knowledge an aspiring designer needs, discussing the process of design, the designer, design methods and techniques, the design product and its qualities, and conditions for interaction design."

Researchers have attempted to identify different types of prototypes, such as low- vs. high-fidelity prototypes, but these attempts have centered on evaluation rather than support of design exploration. There have also been efforts to provide new ways of thinking about the activity of using prototypes, such as experience prototyping and paper prototyping, but these efforts do not provide a discourse for understanding fundamental characteristics of prototypes. In this article, we propose an anatomy of prototypes as a framework for prototype conceptualization.

A vast amount of literature supports the benefits of adopting a mixed approach of strategy: several empirical studies have proved that a hybrid strategy establishes a firm’s performance superiority over the pure strategy choice. The hybrid literature has concentrated on the performance linkage and on the debate countering the pure strategy approach, however very little attention has been paid to the challenges presented by the mixed strategy implementation. In fact, despite the rich empirical literature, it is still not clear how firms that adopt a hybrid strategy may successfully integrate the inherent contradiction of the “Low Cost” and “Differentiation” approaches, escaping from the “Stuck in The Middle” outcome. Consequently, after a careful consultation of the relevant literature, we conclude that several types of hybrid strategy implementation, which should correspond to different strategy-structure-environment paradigm, exist. In order to study the characteristics of these different types of hybrid strategies implementations, we propose a typology composed of four hybrid strategy implementation types, defined by two antecedents of the firm and two antecedents of the environment. As a contribution of this article, the proposed typology has the purpose to fill a methodological gap regarding the adoption of Hybrid strategies and we expect that it could be used as a …"

Time is not perceived, but its existence is inferred while viewing the visual. Representation of time plays a key role to differentiate between the modes of visual narrative.

Lack of access, low awareness, low-risk perception and poverty are all important proximate constraints; however, one of the greatest barriers to the program is rooted in cultural notions of blood, marriage, identity, personhood and kinship in Bengali society.

Power legitimizes hierarchy and authority, and manufactures consent. Its capillary action causes it to spread into every corner and social extremity, but also sets up the possibility of challenge and contestation.Using illustrative examples, we show that in some contexts accountability strategies may confront and transform adverse power relationships.

Such a large number of studies hinders the community from understanding the current research landscape. This paper aims to summarize the current knowledge in applied machine learning for source code analysis. We review studies belonging to twelve categories of software engineering tasks and corresponding machine learning techniques, tools, and datasets that have been applied to solve them. To do so, we conducted an extensive literature search and identified 479 primary studies published between 2011 and 2021. We summarize our observations and findings with the help of the identified studies. Our findings suggest that the use of machine learning techniques for source code analysis tasks is consistently increasing. We synthesize commonly used steps and the overall workflow for each task and summarize machine learning techniques employed. We identify a comprehensive list of available datasets and tools useable in this context. Finally, the paper discusses perceived challenges in this area, including the availability of standard datasets, reproducibility and replicability, and hardware resources."

Monthly time series data spanning the period from 2008 January to November 2016 has been used. The unit root test, the cointegration test, Granger causality test and pooled mean group estimator have been applied to derive the long-run and short-run statistical dynamics. The findings of pooled estimated results of ASIAN 3 countries show that exchange rate has a positive and significant long-run effect on stock markets while the inflation has a negative and insignificant long-run effect. In the short run, there is no statistically significant relationship between macroeconomic variables and stock markets. This study emphasises …"

The lucrative returns and investment opportunities in Asian markets invites attention for potential research in this domain. Default risk is derived from the Merton model after adjusting for emerging market vulnerabilities. Using fixed-effect panel data regression modelling, we found that higher solvency and operating efficiency are the key pull factors that keep the firms away from default. In the long run, expansion potential and sustainability are key factors that pull the firms out of default. Conversely, a higher level of expansion potential, idiosyncratic volatility and size-effects push low-grade firms towards default despite having a higher level of operating efficiency. We conclude that low-grade firms must therefore keep a close eye on …"

    "paper_abstract": "This study extends the application of the Merton (1974) model in six emerging Asian markets to estimate corporate default risk. First, we find that the Merton (1974) model suffers from disproportionate scaling between the book value of debt and the market value of equity due to illiquid corporate bond prices, which we refer to as market-bias. Second, the market-bias is predominantly observed in growth stocks with high price-to-book (PB) value ratios since they are significantly overpriced due to noise-trading. Hence, in the study, we propose the novel approach to control market-bias in the Merton (1974) model by disentangling the asymmetric effects of noise from growth stocks. Third, the analysis uncovered that default probabilities derived from the noise-adjusted Merton model are significantly higher than the Merton model for high and medium-grade firms. Our results provide useful insights to the lenders to ensure …"

Under uncertainty it’s general tendency of an individual to get inspired by decisions of others or mass opinion. However, such herd behavior many times leads to autoregressive affect ie output at some moment is weighted average of past few observation. Hence can autoregressive models be used to predict the outcomes in the situations exhibiting such behavior? Studies have already been done on herd behavior in financial market. So, can models used to forecast financial markets be used to predict general decision making under uncertainty. To prove the validity of the point we conduct a small experiment of human decision making under uncertainty and try to forecast future responses using autoregressive models. A group of students were surveyed such that they can also look upon previous responses which would promote herding. A unique financial market type framework is used to quantify the responses and time series models of auto regression are used to forecast mass opinion."

    "paper_abstract": "Accessing corporate default risk from both micro and macro perspectives has never been the topic of concern until the Global Financial Crisis (GFC, 2008). This empirical paper aimed to examine the effects of systematic risk factors across corporate default risk of enterprises with varying credit ratings. We noticed an asymmetric effect of domestic systematic risk factors such as inflation and short-term interest rates on high, medium, and low-grade firms. They benefit investment-grade firms under favourable economic conditions. However, during adverse times, these factors worsen the financial health of investment-grade firms, along with other medium-and low-grade firms. Second, we found that regional systematic risk factors such as market sentiments coupled with regional volatility amplifies corporate default risk. Our findings also uncovered the asymmetric lag effect of default risk across the high, medium, and low-grade firms. The lower-grade firms are experiencing a more dominant lag than the higher-grade firms. These insights provide valuable information to company management and board members aiming to comprehend the complex dynamics between corporate default risk and systematic risk elements. Our analysis also assists financial institutional investors seeking investment prospects in the Asian region."

Although several studies have explored the factors associated with students’ psychological well-being, limited research has focused on the relation between the overall support for students and psychological well-being. Students of higher education may get formal support, in the form of team environment and institutional support; and informal support, in the form of family and friends’ support. The purpose of this study is to examine the relation of these four kinds of support with psychological well-being of management students. We also examine the intervening role of academic engagement in this relationship. Analysis using structural equation modeling and hierarchical regression on data collected from 309 management students from Indian universities, shows that positive internal team environment, and institutional and family support positively relate to students’ psychological well-being. Academic engagement partially mediates the relation between positive internal team environment and psychological well-being, and family support and psychological well-being. Also, academic engagement fully mediates the relation between institutional support and psychological well-being. The study highlights the significance of internal team environment and institutional support for students’ academic engagement and psychological well-being, and the role of academic engagement in determining well-being. Based on these findings, we suggest interventions that can be undertaken by educational institutions to enhance psychological well-being of …"

    "paper_abstract": "In the last three decades, there has been considerable advancement in the design of information systems used in organizations. Information systems facilitate critical organizational activities like recording and processing of business transactions, analyzing complex and large sets of data and generating management and executive level reports. However, their adoption is generally fraught with challenges because of the negative attitude of employees to the impending change in their work life. Taking into account the enormous investment of cost, time and effort in information system implementation, it is imperative for organizations to recognize and influence employee attitude from the very beginning to secure returns on their investment in the long run. The key employee attitudes that can affect implementation are readiness, openness and commitment to change. Drawing on the theoretical and empirical literature on change management and information system, the paper examines the factors that influence employee attitudes to change, and explores the initiatives that organizations can take to influence them. By conducting investigation both at organizational and individual levels, it proposes a conceptual model indicating determinants of employee attitudes to change and role of organizational development interventions."

Further analysis shows that on an individual level, and with respect to both risky and ambiguous prospects, there is limited incidence of a reflection effect where subjects are risk/ambiguity averse (seeking) in gains and seeking (averse) in losses, though this incidence is higher for ambiguous prospects.

We find that whenever the project is neither too productive, nor too unproductive, reducing such distortion requires unbundling borrower selection and project implementation, with the NGO being involved in borrower selection only.

Together, policy advocacy and partisan endorsements are often better than either alone. Their interaction creates a delegation benefit that makes indirect democracy superior to direct democracy and office-seeking parties better than those motivated by public interest.

    "paper_abstract": "We study a model of electoral competition between two candidates with two orthogonal issues, where candidates are office motivated and committed to a particular position in one of the dimensions, while having the freedom to select (credibly) any position on the other dimension. We analyse two settings: one where both candidates are committed to the same dimension, and the other where each candidate is committed to a different dimension. We focus on characterisation and existence of pure strategy Nash equilibria when the core is empty. We show that if the distribution of voters’ ideal policies is continuously differentiable and has a bounded support, then an equilibrium exists if the candidates are differentiated enough. Our results for the case where the candidates have a common committed issue have implications for the literature on valence."

    "paper_title": "Diamonds, Blood, and Taxes: A Revenue-Centered Framework for Explaining Political Order",
    "paper_abstract": "This article addresses an important gap in research on the causes of civil war: the lack of a theory that explains why lootable resources like alluvial diamonds are linked to civil war in some cases and peace in others. To help fill this gap, we propose a revenue-centered theoretical framework that shifts the focus from rebels to rulers and states, situates rulers in the context of the institutional and economic constraints on their ability to earn revenue, and combines this focus on revenue with a focus on state spending. In countries rich in lootable resources, the ability of rulers to achieve political order depends on (1) the availability of nonlootable resources; (2) the mode of extraction of lootable resources, especially whether they are extracted by hard-to-tax artisans or, alternatively, by large, taxable industrial firms; and (3) patterns of state spending. This framework supplements widely used models of civil war that …"

    "paper_abstract": "This paper offers a first comprehensive account of popular voting intentions in Africa's new electoral democracies. With reference to aggregate and survey data from 16 countries, this paper shows that competitive elections in Africa are more than mere ethnic censuses or simple economic referenda. Instead, Africans engage in both ethnic and economic voting. Not surprisingly, people who belong to the ethnic group in power intend to support the ruling party, in contrast to those who feel a sense of discrimination against their cultural group. But, to an even greater extent, would-be voters in Africa consider policy performance, especially the government's perceived handling of unemployment, inflation, and income distribution. Moreover, a full account of the intended vote choice in Africa also requires recognition that citizens are motivated – sincerely or strategically – by partisan considerations; they vote for established …"

    "paper_abstract": "Building on Fearon and Laitin, who concede in-group policing could be exploited for genocidal purposes instead of moderating interethnic hostilities, the authors seek to explain variation in the scale of ethnic conflict, using data from Rwanda and Burundi. Their computational model assumes individuals vary in their propensity to engage in violence, form independent beliefs about others, and react to public messages about current levels of ethnic aggression. In addition, the dominant ethnic group is subject to genocidal norms—defectors who fail to participate in ethnic violence face sanctions. Their results demonstrate that (1) the scale of violence varies considerably across episodes; (2) interethnic conflicts are not structurally deterministic but rather reflect endogenous interactions; (3) interethnic trust influences patterns of conflict—communities exhibiting high degrees of trust generally experience intense violence …"

    "paper_abstract": "How does segregation shape intergroup violence in contested urban spaces? Should nominal rivals be kept separate or instead more closely integrated? We develop an empirically grounded agent‐based model to understand the sources and patterns of violence in urban areas, employing Jerusalem as a demonstration case and seeding our model with microlevel, geocoded data on settlement patterns. An optimal set of parameters is selected to best fit the observed spatial distribution of violence in the city, with the calibrated model used to assess how different levels of segregation, reflecting various proposed “virtual futures” for Jerusalem, would shape violence. Our results suggest that besides spatial proximity, social distance is key to explaining conflict over urban areas: arrangements conducive to reducing the extent of intergroup interactions—including localized segregation, limits on mobility and migration …"

    "paper_abstract": "Cryptocurrency is a type of virtual or digital currency, which relies on a distributed ledger network (DLT) to combine the core ideas of cryptography with a monetary system to create an anonymous, traceable, secure, and potentially stable currency over the world. Cryptocurrency is organic in nature in a way that it is neither issued nor regulated by any central authority, which makes it immune to any interference from banking regulations. It has been credited with creating unprecedented changes in the economic world. This study comes under exploration analysis. The data is collected from the EBSCO database between March 25, 2020 and December 15, 2020. The prime objectives are to understand the system of cryptocurrency, its viability for industry, and try to foresee its future in the current business world. This manuscript elaborates different aspects of cryptocurrencies, starting from the history and their evolution …"

This was the scenario, before the coronavirus; the alias of COVID-19 pandemic, which was germinated in one of the most scientific cities in china; Wuhan.

    "paper_abstract": "Studies have found that a small scale of operations could limit the firm performance since they do not enjoy economies of scale. Since the microfinance industry is focused on provision of financial services to the poor, performance is measured both from a social as well as financial perspective. As firms increase their scale of operations, their social performance needs to be on par with their financial performance. To measure the effect of scale on performance, we use data from the Microfinance Information Exchange (MIX) market consisting of 245 Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) covering a period of 21 years from 1999 to 2019. The dependent variables are outreach, efficiency, and financial performance. The control variables are age and the regulatory status of the firm. We find that while factors like financial performance, client retention, and measures of operational efficiency are dependent on scale; they come at the …"

    "paper_abstract": "The current study proposes a blockchain-based technology application for managing blood supply chain. Every peer-to-peer transaction in a blockchain that is recorded and stored is suggested to be shared with the entities participating in the transactions. The characteristics of any blockchain used for blood supply chain are that it is immutable, decentralised, consensus-driven and transparent. Being process centric, it would be helpful in managing an efficient blood supply chain while protecting the privacy of the blood donors. Further, the use of Radio frequency identification (RFID) technologies is recommended to prevent errors in blood transfusion as well as improve the quality and productivity of the blood supply chain."
